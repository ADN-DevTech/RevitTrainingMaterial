''' Revit Family Creation API Lab - 1
'''
''' This command defines a minimum family, and creates a column family with a rectangular
''' profile with three types.
'''
''' Objective:
''' ----------
'''
''' In this lab, we learn the following:
'''
'''   0. set up family environment
'''   1. create a simple solid
'''   2. set alignment
'''   3. add types
'''
''' To test this lab, open a family template "Metric Column.rft", and run a command.
'''
''' Context:
''' --------
'''
''' In this lab, we will define a simple rectangular profile like the follow sketch:
'''
'''   3     2
'''    +---+
'''    |   | d    h = height
'''    +---+
'''   0     1
'''   4  w
'''
''' We then, create a box-shape solid using extrusion, align each face of the solid to
''' exisiting reference planes, and define three types with dimensional variations.
'''
''' Desclaimer: code in these labs is written for the purpose of learning the Revit family API.
''' In practice, there will be much room for performance and usability improvement.
''' For code readability, minimum error checking.
